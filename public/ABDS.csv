My overarching research goal is to expand the frontiers of causes of neuronal degeneration in neurodegenerative diseases via computational neuroimaging as well as to develop new therapeutic approaches for alleviating neuronal impairments. I am particularly interested in discovering the functional chemicals in indigenous and common medicinal herbs in West Africa that have neuroprotective properties against neurodegenerative disorders and unravelling the application of data science using algorithms to analyse and interpret neuronal dysfunction so as to improve the therapeutic approach. My present research focuses on how nutritious diets can alleviate non-motor symptoms of neurodegenerative illnesses, downregulate proinflammatory biomarkers involved in neurodegenerative diseases, and improve the overall health of the nervous system, particularly the brain. I am certain that my participation in the African Brain Data Science Academy, especially the application of Python in neuroimaging in December 2024, will have a great impact on my career. This training will enhance networking opportunities for me to advance towards my goal of being an exceptional independent investigator in the region. Finally, the ripple effect of such networking will assist my present research abilities and approaches, boost my overall research output, and enable me to mentor junior neuroscience researchers effectively in the north-eastern states of Nigeria.

This program aligns perfectly with my long-term goal of propelling neuroscience research to the forefront in Africa and all around the world, especially in neurodegenerative diseases.

My background in biomedical and bioinformatics engineering ignited my passion for brain data analysis. Building an EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) for individuals with ALS during my undergraduate studies honed my ability to bridge the gap between theoretical neuroscience and practical applications. Currently, I'm actively strengthening my data science skills while prepping for a neuroscience Master's abroad. I'm particularly interested in utilizing advanced machine learning techniques like deep learning to analyze EEG data and understand the neural correlates of cognitive decline in neurodegenerative diseases. Analyzing EEG data with MNE-Python demonstrates my commitment to understanding neural dynamics. My internship at Dar Al-Fouad Hospital further solidified my technical foundation in data handling and communication, crucial for successful data science endeavors.

The ABDS Academy's focus on responsible brain data management resonates with my vision for neuroscience research.  The opportunity to learn from leading experts and collaborate with fellow African researchers is exciting. I believe my data science background combined with my interest in neuroscience makes me a strong candidate. The hands-on training and mentorship offered by ABDS will equip me with the expertise to contribute meaningfully to data-driven brain research in Africa.

I am eager to join the vibrant African neuroscience community and push data-driven research forward. The ABDS Academy presents a pivotal chance to combine my data science skills with my passion for neuroscience, ultimately allowing me to make a positive impact on the lives of those affected by neurological disorders.

I applied this to healthcare, where I pioneered a model for categorizing depression severity based on social media text. This research, the first in Uganda's local languages, is now expanding to mobile platforms to assist university students and similar groups who might otherwise face stigma.
In imaging, I developed an AI-powered application to diagnose skin diseases, which has the potential to revolutionize dermatology. Furthermore, I am exploring the integration of local languages into large language models (LLMs) to enhance healthcare delivery in resource-limited environments. This innovative approach could significantly improve the accessibility and quality of healthcare in such settings.
Throughout my work, I have been driven by two fundamental questions: How do machines interpret commands and make decisions? And if machine learning engineers say that neural networks are inspired by the human brain, how does a machine's interpretation of multiple languages compare to the brain's processing? These questions, which I am deeply curious about, could potentially lead to the development of widely acceptable AI systems through the use of explainable AI. This would not only enhance the meaningful translation of medical information into local languages, but also improve decision-making transparency between models and humans, a crucial aspect of AI development.

Working in the field of health, my goal is to elevate the overall public health, providing comprehensive care and services to those deserving, as universal healthcare is a fundamental right for every individual in this world. I have had this dream since I had a Certificate of training program Basic life support, Basic CPR, and First Aid ( May 2015) at Benghazi Medical Center.

During the civil war, I volunteered at Benghazi Medical Centre. The patients (surgical, oncology, and diabetes) had some difficulties, including food insecurity, inadequate access to medications and testing supplies, and a shortage of providers with expertise in clinical and nutrition care. From then, I became interested in the management of clinical nutrition, and I just fell in love, saying to myself that this is what I want to continue my study.

This experience proved to be greatly beneficial when I started my career as a clinical nutritionist in the surgical intensive care unit at Benghazi Medical Center in 2016. My passion for clinical nutrition has been growing since I began attending courses and workshops related to therapeutic nutrition, particularly enteral and parenteral nutrition. In 2019, I started giving lectures to my colleagues in the hospital on the latest studies related to clinical nutrition for patients in intensive care and critical medical conditions. This initiated a training series for clinical dietitians in hospitals and new graduates in the field, extending into 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, where I collaborated to develop a protocol for critically ill patients with the virus. Alongside my daily work in the ICU with morning and evening shifts throughout the week, I continued conducting training courses for dietitians. By the end of 2023 and the beginning of this year, I transitioned to delivering these courses within different healthcare facilities across the city, including clinics and hospitals.
