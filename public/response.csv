As a neurologist with interest in clinic research on Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease, I would to foster my experience on neuroimaging markers of these conditions. 
Researching protective factors, cognitive,neuroimaging and biological markers of Alzheimer’s disease and related dementia is my motivation to significantly decrease the spread of dementia. 
Raising awareness and implementing local solutions with different stakeholders are keys strategies to reduce        the        impact        of        dementia        worldwide. 
The Democratic Republic of Congo (most populous francophone country in the world) has diverse ethnic groups where abnormal behaviors of elders are often attributed to witchcraft leading to stigmatization and discrimination. I have the goal to change Congolese’s perception through activities culturally adapted in different levels (community, research, health policy). 
","I have developed a passion for this specialty due to my personal history. There was an elderly neighbor who presented abnormal behavior (she could go out of the house and then got lost on the way before being brought back by a neighborhood acquaintance) for which she was considered a witch by her relatives because they did not understand how she can get lost without a valid reason. This situation intrigued me because I always wondered why she was acting this way.
After a certain period of time, the woman experienced an unexpected event where she had been out for 3 days, and then she was found dead in a town far from her place of residence. This surprised me and touched my heart. Thus, I became interested in knowing more about the functioning of the brain and its implications for our daily behavior. After my graduation, I decided to work on neurology at the Neuropsychopathologic Center in Kinshasa (the only national center in the country)

I have been involved in many community-based research studies on dementia and Alzheimer's disease since 2017. Our research team conducted the first study on the prevalence of dementia in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). We are in the process of setting up a community site to serve people with degenerative conditions (dementia, Alzheimer's disease) and improving public awareness of these medical conditions. As a neurologist, I have experience organizing medical consultations and awareness events in both hospital and community settings for patients with cognitive disorders in Kinshasa. 

With that experience, I had the opportunity to be selected and received a grant for my fellowship at the University of California San Francisco, Global Brain Health Institute, where I am currently immersed in a deep training program on different aspects of brain health (clinic, prevention, health policy, health economics, community outreach, and treatment, among other focuses). My fellowship will end in August 2023, at which point I will travel back to DRC to continue working in the field. 

I have an ambitious project in the long term that will focus on the creation of a center of excellence for the care and research on degenerative diseases, the first of its kind in DRC. This project will be called in Lingala ""KIMOBANGE NA ESENGO"" (= HAPPY AGEING) in order to allow the elderly in our community to benefit from physical, psychological and social support.

The best game we do play in our leisure time is to compete on capturing a particular object to see who will produce a clearer image and that helps sharpen my skills in capturing objects at the best angles to produce a good image. Although I know the best angle to produce a good image of an object, the mechanism or the principles of imaging is an area I still aspire to get a deeper understanding of because imaging is very important both clinical and research.
My interest in imaging enables me to enjoy my postgraduate program in Human Anatomy. Histology and microscopy are my best-performing courses in my course work because the relevance of a microscope in producing a better image lies in three principles namely, magnification, contrast, and resolution which I have deep knowledge about. Understanding these principles makes it easier for me to know the relevance of the different types of microscopes in imaging. 
During my postgraduate programm neuroanatomy lectures were the most boring class because only the lecturer could see where the tracts or nuclei of the nerves are found it was like a magical class even at a stage, I doubted my sight and visited the eye clinic only to be told that I am fine. After the visit to the clinic, we were tracing the lateral spinothalamic tract and I told my lecturer that I cannot see the tract he responded to me that I should have faith and I will see, and the whole class was thrown into laughter. This challenged me to search for better ways how to produce clearer images of nerves that will help me in my future work as an anatomy educator, my attention was diverted to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Currently, I know basic coding and Python in an attempt to learn image processes involved in MRI. I had a hand try on image manipulation tools such as Numpy, Scipy, and SimpleITK. 
I have much interested to pursue Ph.D. in computational neurobiology and the African Brain Data Science workshop will offer me the opportunity to learn from experience tutors and to work on various projects to sharpen my skills in neuroimaging.

From a young age I have been fascinated by how biological processes happen and work, during my childhood days there was an elderly man in my neighbourhood who was quite healthy but suddenly I realised I never saw him around like before, then I asked my parents about his whereabout, just for me to be told he was down with stroke and he had not been able to move around. Apparently, he had been paralysed on one side of his body. Out of curiosity, I asked from my parents what stroke was, then I was simply told it is a condition that affects the brain and its function. Personally, that was a moment of epiphany because I never knew an organ in the skull could have such a magnificent effect on the human body. That day laid the foundation for my interest in the brain and the nervous system and I was captivated by the complexity of a fundamental part of our body.

During my undergraduate studies, the interest was further fuelled when I started taking courses on neuroanatomy and neurophysiology which made the nervous system more realistic and interesting due to the laboratory and research exposure through organized departmental practical classes. In order to explore neuroscience in greater depth, particularly in clinical setting, I've been working for over a year as an EEG technologist at the EEG unit of the University College Hospital, Ibadan. The experience has exposed me to several brain and nervous system conditions like dementia, stroke, sleep disorders, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy and other seizure disorders, as well as their various managements. As a person who loves to positively impact the society, I share my knowledge and also guide undergraduates on how to perform the EEG procedure. I am also a healthcare data analyst in training and I appreciate the role data play in giving insight for better healthcare delivery particularly in the field of neuroscience.

Therefore, as I engage in more neurodiagnostic procedures, analysis and research, brain data are generated and expertise is needed for appropriate collection,  processing and analysis of these data which is imperative for decision-making and overall improvement.

It investigates many systems that contribute to the diseased condition, including cognition, information processing, and brain alterations. Neuroimaging has significantly advanced in recent years and evolved into an effective tool for medical investigation and diagnosis. Higher standards for neuroimaging equipment and subsequent data processing have been proposed in response to the rising frequency of neurological illnesses, and significant progress has been achieved in this area.
As many researchers struggle to access, organize, and evaluate the deluge of new data, these innovations are anticipated to offer new and significant insights into the functioning of the human brain. However, they also create new difficulties in the technical know-how of data analysis. Higher standards of computational practice are also required due to concerns about repeatability and increasing rigour in the reporting of scientific discoveries.

My interest in neuroscience has always been very broad: from molecular, to cellular, and systems- wide. While this means that I am comfortable to engage with diverse disciplines of neuroscience in my reading and learning, my understanding of how one discipline weaves into the other is missing a crucial component: translation. I believe that taking a computational approach to how the molecular patterns, cellular communication, and systems-wide functioning interact is a necessary tool for any neuroscientist, data-scientist, philosopher, sociologist… I do not participate in science to harbour knowledge. I participate for the expansion of a knowledge base that should be accessible, affordable, and applicable to people of diverse backgrounds.

I am a multi-modal learner. Predominantly, I like to learn through imagery and written information. What I find captivating about neuroimaging is that the molecular, cellular and systems-wide approaches intersect in exquisitely informative and translatable ways. Imagery transcends language barriers. I recently began coding in R, and I noticed how quickly I adapted to the language and flexibility of ways in which one can accomplish a particular outcome. I have worked with both animal research in neuroscience as well as in human research of the neurosciences, and my passion sways in the direction of “wet lab” work. Why? I am socially anxious and have learned that I am easily overwhelmed by the demands of being patient-facing in a research position. I much prefer the meditation and repetition of following the protocol in a wet lab. There is more predictability therein. I feel as though brain data sciences will award me that predictability for systems-wide troubleshooting that is difficult to achieve comfortably in human research. 

Neuroscientific data sharing is like sharing scientific riches amongst colleagues. I stand with the decentralization of data production and processing. I think that there is particular importance of African research led by Africans, for Africans – or, at least, data that is adaptable to be locally relevant.

Data science is applied to genomics, drug design, microbes curation, proteomics, and more. 
Its application in neuroimaging is of utmost importance, considering everyone must do scans at the hospital. It's the most efficient procedure for getting underlying disease factors, especially in adults. Doing the scans is not the problem; analyzing quite a number within a short time frame to deliver efficiently is where data science comes in. 

I'm Zainab Ashimiyu-Abdusalam, and I have a background in Pharmacology, Therapeutics, and Toxicology. How does this connect to neuroimaging? In pharmacology, we have a course titled Neuropharmacology. Neuropharmacology is the study of the effects of drugs on the nervous system. In simpler terms, the analysis of the impact of drugs on the brain. Neuroimaging occurs when you are undergoing a study protocol to see the difference in the neuro action after drug effects. This brain image data assists in understanding therapeutic agents' Core mechanism of action. Collecting, processing, and analyzing these results efficiently produce an effective drug for the nervous system.

Why do I want to participate? As an early career researcher, my skill is well-spent. To emphasize the importance, the neuroimaging data science skill is transferable. Not only is the process used in neuroimaging data analysis, but such a data science process can also be used in molecular imaging skills. That's one of the reasons I'd like to participate. Also, to network with fellow researchers in the field. 

My long-term goal is to be a machine learning scientist, like an applied medical and life science scientist. This program is a stepping stone to that goal, and more scientists are encouraged to pick up their data science skills. We are the ones most capable of interpreting our scientific results. I am currently a KaggleX mentee and a Data Science Network Mentee; merging this expertise will solidify my portfolio. Also, I hope to pass one or two pieces of knowledge to my co-attendee as much as I'm learning.
